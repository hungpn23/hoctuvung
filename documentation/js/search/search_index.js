betterquizlet\nOverview\nbetterquizlet is a NestJS-based backend application designed for vocabulary learning. It utilizes a robust stack including PostgreSQL (via MikroORM) for data persistence, Redis for caching and queues (via BullMQ), and ImageKit for media management.\nFeatures\nThis project showcases robust backend development practices, including:\n\nAuthentication:\nSecure Refresh Token Rotation for enhanced session management (support multiple divices).\nSuccessful implementation of Google OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow.\n\n\nUser Management:\nEfficient image upload handling via background jobs using BullMQ.\n\n\n\nThe codebase is carefully crafted, adhering to best practices for maintainability and clarity, resulting in clean TypeScript.\nArchitecture & Tech Stack\nCore Framework\n\nFramework: NestJS\nLanguage: TypeScript\nPackage Manager: pnpm\n\nData Layer\n\nDatabase: PostgreSQL\nORM: MikroORM\nConfig: src/db/mikro-orm.config.ts\nEntities: src/**/*.entity.ts\nMigrations: Auto-schema update enabled in main.ts\n\n\nSeeding: @mikro-orm/seeder\n\nCaching & Queues\n\nRedis: Used for both caching and message queues.\nQueues: BullMQ (background jobs handled within feature modules).\nCaching: @nestjs/cache-manager with KeyvRedis.\n\nExternal Services\n\nImage Processing: ImageKit (@imagekit/nodejs).\nAuthentication: Google OAuth, JWT (@nestjs/jwt, argon2 for password hashing).\n\nAPI Structure\n\nPrefix: Configurable (default: /api).\nDocumentation: Swagger UI available at /api/docs (assuming prefix is api).\nValidation: Global ValidationPipe (transform & whitelist enabled).\nGlobal Guards: AuthGuard applied globally.\nModules:\nsrc/api: Core business logic (Auth, Deck, Study, User).\nsrc/common: Shared constants, decorators, filters, guards, pipes.\nsrc/config: Environment configuration.\n\n\n\nDevelopment Workflow\nPrerequisites\n\nNode.js\nDocker & Docker Compose (for DB and Redis)\npnpm\n\nSetup & Installation\n\nInstall dependencies:Example :pnpm install\nEnvironment Configuration:\nCopy .env.example to .env.local.\nFill in the required environment variables (DB credentials, Redis, Google Auth, ImageKit).\n\n\nStart Infrastructure:Example :docker compose -f compose.local.yml --env-file .env.local up -d\n\nRunning the Application\n\nDevelopment (Watch Mode):Example :pnpm run start:dev\nProduction:Example :pnpm run start:prod\n\nTesting\n\nUnit Tests: pnpm test\nE2E Tests: pnpm test:e2e\nCoverage: pnpm test:cov\n\nCode Quality & Standards\n\nLinting: pnpm lint (ESLint)\nFormatting: pnpm format (Prettier)\nCommit Hooks: Husky is configured with commitlint and lint-staged. Ensure commit messages follow conventional commits.\n\nDirectory Layout\n\nsrc/api: Feature modules containing Controllers, Services, DTOs, and Entities.\nsrc/common: Reusable components (Guards, Filters, Decorators).\nsrc/config: Configuration namespaces using @nestjs/config.\nsrc/db: Database-related configuration and seeds.\nsrc/imagekit: ImageKit integration module.\ntest: End-to-end
